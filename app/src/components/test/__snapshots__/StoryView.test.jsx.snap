                  MUMBAI: With almost 1.4 lakh Covid-19 deaths since the pandemic began, the cash-strapped Maharashtra government is looking at a payout of over Rs 700 crore in terms of compensation from the State Disaster Response Fund ( SDRF ).
                </span>
                <span>
                   
                  This, after the Centre fixed an ex-gratia payment of Rs 50,000 to families of Covid victims in the Supreme Court, to be paid by states from the fund.With the SDRF already stretched with payouts for Covid relief and natural calamities, the state is likely to ask the Centre to increase its contribution to the SDRF, said sources.
                </span>
                <span>
                   
                  Since Maharashtra recorded the highest number of Covid cases and fatalities in the country, it is the state which will face the highest payout through the SDRF.The SDRF is of around Rs 4,200 crore.
                </span>
                <span>
                   
                  Also, the state has faced multiple natural calamities, for which payouts are made from the SDRF.
                </span>
                <span>
                   
                  But the SDRF will be exhausted with payments for various natural calamities and the burden will come on the state budget,” said a senior official.The Centre informed the Supreme Court about the ex-gratia amount fixed by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

                  Mumbai: “The prohibition on publishing the names, address or other personal identifiable information of the parties is absolute,” said the Bombay HC in its September 24 order issuing guidelines for sexual harassment at workplace cases.It directed all persons, including the media, to ensure strict compliance and any failure would amount to contempt of court.

                <span>
                   
                  “In the order sheets, the names of the parties will not be mentioned,” it said, adding that the endeavour will be to anonymize the identities of the parties, such as email ID, mobile or telephone number and address.

                  The proposal was floated by the state’s ministry of tourism in December and was a long-pending demand from Shiv Sena’s youth wing, Yuva Sena.The university will also explore internship opportunities for history and tourism students from their campus and affiliated colleges in these guided tours.The MoU was signed between Directorate of Tourism, the university, and Tourist Guide Association (TOGA).

                  The suppliers of the 31 lakh cubic metres or roughly 400MT LMO will have to keep oxygen available for 48 hours at all centres at all times and provide more oxygen within 24 hours of the BMC’s request as required, said officials.The BMC faced a short but critical oxygen crisis during the second wave.

                  At the peak in April 2020, there was a demand for over 260-270MT, triggering a frantic search for close to a week.The BMC gave a Rs 205-crore contract to instal oxygen generation plants at 11 jumbo centres and field hospitals this August.

                  In 2020, 121 elderly people from the city ended their lives, up 31% over the previous year, reveals data from the Mumbai police.Information accessed by RTI activist Jeetendra Ghadge of The Young Whistleblowers’ Foundation shows 1,282 citizens committed suicide in Mumbai in 2020,an average of three individuals per day compared to 1,229 in 2019.
                </span>
                <span>

                <span>
                   
                  They came under severe stress which affected their mental health,” said Ghadge.The tragic upward graph of suicides among senior citizens does not surprise octogenarian Manohar Rangnekar, director of Samaritans Mumbai, which runs a three-hour-a-day suicide prevention helpline.

                <span>
                   
                  Steeped in the grind of making ends meet, "the younger generation was unable to take care of the elderly," says Rangnekar.In a recent survey titled 'The Silent Tormentor -- Covid-19 and the elderly' by the NGO HelpAge India, fractured communication with loved ones and an increasing sense of despondency were the overarching feelings conveyed by senior citizens.

                  He confirmed he would travel back to Sardinia for his hearing there next Monday that will weigh an extradition request from Spain.Puigdemont was arrested in Sardinia on Thursday and spent the night in prison before a brief court hearing a day later that authorised his provisional release.The 58-year-old is wanted by Madrid on charges of sedition for leading a failed Catalan bid to declare independence from Spain in October 2017, fleeing to Belgium to avoid prosecution.His lawyer in Sardinia has insisted there was no basis for his arrest, nor for his extradition.Puigdemont said his required presence in Italy “isn’t easy… because it coincides with the plenary week” of the European Parliament.

                <span>

                <span>
                   
                  Despite a ban by Madrid, Catalonia’s separatist regional government under Puigdemont tried to stage an independence referendum in 2017, which was marred by police violence.

                  From 11:59pm tonight additional reasons for permitted travel will be introduced for movement across the Auckland boundary, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins says.

                <span>
                   
                  The additional permitted travel reasons are for:

o Move into a new property that they have purchased or rented

“There are people in Auckland who need to move to a new home or start a new job outside of Auckland, as well as families whose ability to maintain shared childcare arrangements has been restricted,” Chris Hipkins said.
                </span>
                <span>
                   
                  “People crossing the boundary for shared caregiving arrangements will need to have a test within seven days of each crossing, as we recognise these arrangements may involve more back-and-forth travel than other reasons.
                </span>
                <span>
                   
                  “People relocating or returning home will need to carry proof of their reason for travel, and not travel if they are unwell or have any symptoms of COVID-19.
                </span>
                <span>
                   
                  “Most people are still not permitted to travel and it is really important that anyone with symptoms or who has been at a location of interest does not travel, isolates at home and gets a COVID-19 test,” Chris Hipkins said.
